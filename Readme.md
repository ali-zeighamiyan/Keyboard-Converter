# Keyboard Detecter & Converter

## This app is just for fun!

## Usecase
### I use Persian and English keyboard(PC or Laptop). Most of the time i forgot to change the language to the desired and i write something, suddenly I raise my head and see what I just wrote!!! bla bla bla ... So I told myself if i train a simple model to detect and automatically convert the input text to desired it will be usefull. So i did it! 

## How To Use?
#### You should Download the my fasttext models or your own models that have the abilty of diagnosing the real meaning text VS junck text. Put them in root of the search_converter. Then Run it ... Feel free to change it to your desired app

## Warning!!
### This app is for english and persian ... so if you want other languages, you first must train a model based on that language and put keyboard alternatives to the app for the converting part.
